Data Structure and Algorithm with JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most popular modern programing language. It's widely used for web development, mobile apps development and interactive data visualation.

Let use JavaScript to explore the world of data structure and algorithm (DSA). For computer science students, C/C++ or Java will usually be the chosen language for learning data structure and algorithm. But this course is not aiming computer science students. Instead, we are aiming none-tech students such as students of data analytics and data science. For stuents in these domain, Python, R or JavaScript are usually a better choice, especially when one has to consider language learning curve and coding productivity.

We will learn the basic idea of data strucutre, algorithm in the language of JavaScript. Modern data science related programming lanagages usually come with rich data processing feature or add-on for data science applications. And therefore in real world, one really have to write codes that we are demonstrating in this course. But knowing what really are happening in the perscpective of data structure and algorithm and how they are addressing/solving real life problems will help to better understand more complicated data processing and data science use cases.
