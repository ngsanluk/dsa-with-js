// let's do a simple algorithm

// an algorithm are written to deal with data
// that's whey data structure and algorithm are always mentioned together
// now let's declare an array of numbers
// array is one of the most used data structure
// for various computation problems, such as sorting and searching

numbers = [30, 50, 20, 40, 10]; // an array of 5 integer number

// for loop is widely used together with array data
// for example - to iterate the array (means visit each member elemment once)
// believe it or not, this is already an algorithm.
// only it doesn't do very complex things

console.log("Printing numbers of array one-by-one ...");
for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}

// but remember: even a small coding error will break the algorithm
// let's play around with some common seen bugs: marginal index, growing array size
